Azure Virtual Network (VNet) Best Practices

GENERAL DESIGN:
- Design the virtual network IP space based on RFC1918 and avoid overlap with on-premises networks.
- Use address spaces large enough to support future scaling without the need to re-IP.
- Use subnets to segment workloads logically (e.g., frontend, backend, database, management).
- Reserve dedicated subnets for gateway, bastion, and firewall if needed.
- Avoid overly large subnets (wasteful IP consumption and harder to manage).

NAME & TAGGING:
- Use consistent naming conventions for VNets and subnets (e.g., `<env>-vnet-westus`).
- Tag VNets with environment, owner, and purpose for governance and cost tracking.

SECURITY:
- Apply Network Security Groups (NSGs) at subnet level to enforce granular traffic control.
- Use application security groups (ASGs) to group VM rules by role.
- Deny all inbound traffic by default and explicitly allow only required ports.
- Monitor NSG flow logs to identify unexpected traffic patterns.
- Use Azure Firewall or third-party firewalls for centralized inspection.
- For public-facing resources, place them behind a load balancer or Application Gateway + WAF.

NETWORK ACCESS:
- Use Private Link to connect to Azure PaaS services (e.g., Storage, SQL) securely.
- Prefer Service Endpoints when Private Link is not available, but avoid both on the same subnet.
- Use User-Defined Routes (UDRs) for forced tunneling or custom traffic paths.
- Enable DNS resolution via custom DNS servers or Azure-provided DNS as appropriate.
- Use VNet Peering for cross-VNet communication (within/between regions) with low latency.

AVAILABILITY & RESILIENCE:
- Use multiple Availability Zones or regions when designing critical architectures.
- Implement redundant VPN gateways or ExpressRoute circuits for HA.
- Ensure UDRs and NSGs are replicated across critical paths to avoid asymmetric routing.

PERFORMANCE:
- Avoid NSG rules with wide address ranges or wildcard sources.
- Use accelerated networking for supported VM SKUs to reduce latency.
- Segment workloads by performance sensitivity and apply appropriate controls.

MONITORING:
- Enable NSG flow logs and send to Log Analytics for analysis.
- Monitor metrics for VPN Gateway, ExpressRoute, Load Balancers, and traffic throughput.
- Set alerts on bandwidth thresholds, gateway health, and unauthorized traffic attempts.

HYBRID CONNECTIVITY:
- For on-premises to Azure, prefer ExpressRoute for high-throughput, low-latency needs.
- Use VPN Gateway with active-active configuration for production workloads.
- Use BGP to dynamically advertise routes where possible.
- Keep gateway subnets separate and sized properly (/27 or larger).

GOVERNANCE:
- Use Azure Policy to enforce VNet configurations (e.g., deny internet-facing subnets).
- Restrict creation of VNets to certain regions or naming patterns if needed.
- Review NSG and UDR compliance via Microsoft Defender for Cloud.

RECOMMENDED TOOLS:
- Azure Network Watcher: connection troubleshoot, flow logs, IP flow verify.
- Azure Firewall Manager for managing global firewall policies.
- Azure Monitor for network metrics and health.
- Microsoft Defender for Cloud for threat detection and hardening guidance.
