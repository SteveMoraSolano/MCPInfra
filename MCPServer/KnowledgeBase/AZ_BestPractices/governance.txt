Azure Governance & Management Best Practices

GENERAL GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES:
- Establish clear boundaries using Management Groups, Subscriptions, Resource Groups, and RBAC scopes.
- Apply governance at scale with Azure Policy, Blueprints, and tagging strategies.
- Separate environments (e.g., dev, test, prod) at the subscription or resource group level.
- Document naming conventions, role assignments, and resource hierarchy.

MANAGEMENT GROUPS & SUBSCRIPTIONS:
- Use Management Groups to reflect organizational structure (e.g., by business unit or environment).
- Use separate subscriptions for production and non-production workloads.
- Group subscriptions under management groups for centralized policy assignment and budgeting.
- Delegate subscription creation and management through custom roles or Azure Landing Zones.

ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL (RBAC):
- Follow least privilege principle in all role assignments.
- Use built-in roles (e.g., Reader, Contributor) whenever possible.
- Create custom roles only when necessary and scope them to specific resource groups or subscriptions.
- Regularly audit RBAC assignments and remove unused or excessive permissions.
- Use Azure AD groups to manage access rather than individual user assignments.

TAGGING STRATEGY:
- Define a required set of tags (e.g., Environment, Owner, CostCenter, Project, Confidentiality).
- Use Azure Policy to enforce required tags and tag formats.
- Automate tag application using Azure Functions, Logic Apps, or Infrastructure as Code.
- Use tags to group resources for cost analysis, automation, and compliance reporting.

AZURE POLICY:
- Use built-in policy definitions to enforce configurations (e.g., allowed SKUs, secure transfer).
- Create custom policies to meet organizational compliance or security standards.
- Assign policies at the management group or subscription level to enforce consistency.
- Use policy initiatives (policy sets) for grouped enforcement (e.g., security baseline).
- Monitor compliance state in the Azure Policy dashboard and take action on non-compliant resources.

BLUEPRINTS (LEGACY / OPTIONAL):
- Use Azure Blueprints to deploy standard environments with predefined templates, policies, and roles.
- Consider using Bicep and Azure Landing Zones as a modern alternative to Blueprints.
- Note: Azure Blueprints is being deprecated â€” prefer ARM templates or Bicep modules for new workloads.

RESOURCE ORGANIZATION:
- Use Resource Groups to organize related resources that share a lifecycle.
- Avoid placing unrelated workloads in the same resource group.
- Structure resource groups logically: by workload, application, or environment.
- Apply RBAC and policy at the resource group level for isolation and control.

COST MANAGEMENT & BUDGETING:
- Enable Cost Management + Billing in all subscriptions.
- Set budgets and create alerts for teams or projects based on tags.
- Analyze cost trends monthly and optimize underused resources.
- Use reservation recommendations and Azure Advisor for discounts and optimization.

COMPLIANCE & AUDITING:
- Enable activity logs in all subscriptions and export to Log Analytics or Storage for long-term retention.
- Review access logs, policy compliance, and configuration drift regularly.
- Use Microsoft Defender for Cloud to assess regulatory compliance and security posture.
- Document governance strategy and perform periodic reviews with stakeholders.

RECOMMENDED TOOLS:
- Azure Policy (for enforcement)
- Azure Resource Graph (for querying resources at scale)
- Azure Monitor / Log Analytics (for auditing and compliance)
- Azure Cost Management
- Microsoft Defender for Cloud (compliance recommendations)
- Azure Landing Zones / Enterprise Scale
