Azure Monitoring & Observability Best Practices

GENERAL PRINCIPLES:
- Implement centralized monitoring across all services using Azure Monitor.
- Ensure observability at multiple levels: infrastructure, platform services, applications, and security.
- Standardize the use of Log Analytics workspaces across subscriptions.
- Use consistent tagging to group logs and metrics by environment, project, and owner.

LOGGING & DIAGNOSTIC SETTINGS:
- Enable diagnostic settings for all supported Azure resources (VMs, storage, databases, networking).
- Send diagnostics to a centralized Log Analytics Workspace.
- Include both logs and metrics when configuring diagnostic settings.
- Retain logs for at least 30â€“90 days, depending on compliance requirements.

AZURE MONITOR COMPONENTS:
- **Metrics**: Use for near real-time numeric data (e.g., CPU %, disk IO).
- **Logs**: Use for detailed, queryable structured data via Log Analytics.
- **Alerts**: Create alerts based on metrics, logs, or activity logs.
- **Dashboards & Workbooks**: Use to visualize key indicators.
- **Autoscale**: Use metric-based autoscaling rules for compute resources.

ALERTING:
- Create action groups for notification via email, SMS, webhooks, Logic Apps, etc.
- Use severity levels to classify alerts (Sev 0 = critical, Sev 3 = low priority).
- Use dynamic thresholds to avoid alert noise in fluctuating workloads.
- Create alerts on:
  - CPU/Memory thresholds
  - Disk space nearing capacity
  - Failed logins or suspicious authentication
  - VM stopped or unhealthy
  - Cost spikes or budget thresholds

APPLICATION MONITORING:
- Use Application Insights for performance, request tracking, dependencies, and telemetry.
- Correlate logs across distributed systems using telemetry IDs and trace context.
- Enable distributed tracing for APIs, microservices, and serverless components.
- Monitor response times, failure rates, and user behavior.

SECURITY MONITORING:
- Enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud and configure alerts for threat detection.
- Monitor NSG flow logs and firewall logs for unexpected traffic.
- Enable Azure Activity Logs and route them to a Log Analytics Workspace or Event Hub.
- Integrate with Microsoft Sentinel for SIEM use cases if needed.

LOG ANALYTICS BEST PRACTICES:
- Design queries to be efficient: filter early, limit time ranges, and project only necessary fields.
- Use saved queries and templates for recurring reports.
- Organize content using categories and folders in the workspace.
- Apply role-based access control to control log access at the workspace level.

COST OPTIMIZATION:
- Avoid overcollecting logs by disabling verbose diagnostics unless needed.
- Set retention policies to archive or delete logs after required period.
- Split non-critical workloads into separate Log Analytics Workspaces if necessary.

GOVERNANCE & COMPLIANCE:
- Enforce diagnostic settings via Azure Policy to avoid gaps in observability.
- Use policies to ensure logs are being sent to a central workspace.
- Validate retention and privacy settings against compliance standards (e.g., ISO, SOC, GDPR).

RECOMMENDED TOOLS:
- Azure Monitor
- Log Analytics
- Application Insights
- Network Watcher
- Microsoft Sentinel (advanced scenarios)
- Azure Policy (for enforcement)
- Workbooks & Dashboards
