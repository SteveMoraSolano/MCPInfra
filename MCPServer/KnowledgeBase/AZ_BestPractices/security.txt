Azure Security Best Practices

GENERAL PRINCIPLES:
- Follow Zero Trust architecture principles: never trust, always verify.
- Enforce least privilege access across all services.
- Enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud and review Secure Score regularly.
- Use role-based access control (RBAC) for all resources.
- Audit and rotate secrets and credentials periodically.

IDENTITY & ACCESS MANAGEMENT:
- Enable Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all users.
- Use Conditional Access policies to restrict risky sign-ins.
- Use Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to manage Just-In-Time access.
- Assign only built-in roles or custom roles with minimal permissions.
- Use Azure AD groups to manage access at scale.

CREDENTIALS & KEY MANAGEMENT:
- NEVER hardcode secrets or credentials.
- Store all secrets, tokens, certificates in Azure Key Vault.
- Enable purge protection and soft-delete in Key Vault.
- Enable Key Vault firewall and private endpoint access where possible.
- Use managed identities (System-assigned or User-assigned) instead of client secrets.

NETWORK SECURITY:
- Restrict NSG (Network Security Group) rules to only allow required traffic.
- Block all inbound public access unless explicitly needed.
- Use Azure Firewall or third-party appliances for advanced filtering.
- Use Private Link or Service Endpoints instead of public IPs.
- Apply Just-In-Time VM Access via Microsoft Defender for Cloud.

STORAGE SECURITY:
- Require secure transfer (HTTPS only) for all storage accounts.
- Enable soft-delete for blobs, file shares, and containers.
- Use Shared Access Signature (SAS) with least privilege and short expiry.
- Prefer Azure AD authentication over access keys.
- Restrict access via firewall and virtual networks.

LOGGING, MONITORING & DETECTION:
- Enable diagnostic settings for all critical resources and send to Log Analytics.
- Monitor Azure Activity Logs for unauthorized or unexpected changes.
- Enable Microsoft Defender for each supported resource type (e.g., VMs, SQL, Storage).
- Set up alerts for suspicious behavior (e.g., large data downloads, failed logins).
- Integrate with SIEM (e.g., Microsoft Sentinel) for advanced detection.

SECURITY UPDATES & PATCHING:
- Enable automatic OS and software updates for all Azure VMs.
- Use Azure Update Manager or Azure Automation for patching management.
- Monitor patch compliance using Defender for Cloud.

APPLICATION SECURITY:
- Use Application Gateway WAF (Web Application Firewall) for web workloads.
- Enable HTTPS-only on App Services, Functions, Front Doors, and Gateways.
- Use Managed Certificates or Azure Key Vault Certificates.
- Always validate input to avoid injection attacks.

CONTAINER SECURITY:
- Use Azure Policy to restrict container images to trusted registries.
- Scan images in Azure Container Registry for vulnerabilities.
- Use Defender for Containers (AKS, ACI) for runtime protection.
- Apply network policies in AKS to restrict pod communication.

DATABASE SECURITY:
- Enable advanced threat protection on SQL, Cosmos DB, and PostgreSQL.
- Use Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) where available.
- Use firewall rules and VNet service endpoints for access control.
- Always use managed identities for access from apps.

RECOMMENDED TOOLS:
- Microsoft Defender for Cloud (Free tier enabled by default)
- Microsoft Sentinel for SIEM & SOAR
- Azure Policy for enforcement and compliance
- Azure Key Vault for secrets and certificates
- Azure AD Identity Protection
