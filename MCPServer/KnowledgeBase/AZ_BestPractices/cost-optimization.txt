Azure Cost Optimization Best Practices

GENERAL STRATEGIES:
- Continuously review resource usage and shut down idle or unused resources.
- Set up budget alerts and cost anomaly detection in Azure Cost Management.
- Use tagging (e.g., "Environment", "Owner", "Project") for cost allocation and tracking.
- Regularly analyze cost by resource group, service, and location.

VIRTUAL MACHINES:
- Right-size VMs based on CPU/memory utilization (use Azure Advisor recommendations).
- Use B-series or D-series burstable VMs for low-usage workloads.
- Shut down non-production VMs automatically outside working hours.
- Use Reserved Instances (RI) for stable workloads with 1 or 3-year commitments.
- Leverage Azure Hybrid Benefit for Windows Server or SQL Server if licensed.

STORAGE ACCOUNTS:
- Use lifecycle management rules to move data to cooler access tiers (Cool, Archive).
- Delete unused disks, snapshots, backups, or orphaned resources.
- Choose the correct redundancy option (e.g., LRS for dev/test vs. GRS for prod).
- Enable blob soft-delete only if necessary to avoid retention costs.

DATABASES:
- Use Azure SQL Serverless or Hyperscale for bursty or unpredictable workloads.
- Auto-pause idle databases in development environments.
- Consolidate multiple small databases into elastic pools.
- Monitor query performance to avoid over-provisioning.

APP SERVICES & FUNCTIONS:
- Use Azure Functions (serverless) for event-driven or infrequent workloads.
- Set scaling limits to avoid uncontrolled cost spikes.
- Use free/shared pricing tiers for dev/testing when possible.
- Automatically clean up stale deployment slots and test environments.

CONTAINERS & KUBERNETES:
- Use Azure Container Instances (ACI) or Azure Container Apps for short-lived tasks.
- Right-size AKS node pools and use cluster autoscaler.
- Use spot VMs for AKS workloads tolerant to interruptions.
- Clean up unused images in Azure Container Registry (ACR).

NETWORKING:
- Remove unused public IPs, NICs, and load balancers.
- Disable diagnostic logs to Storage when not needed (or redirect to Log Analytics).
- Consolidate NSGs when possible to reduce complexity and management cost.

MONITORING & LOGGING:
- Use sampling and filtering in Application Insights to control telemetry volume.
- Set retention policies in Log Analytics to minimize long-term storage costs.
- Route logs to archive storage if long-term compliance is required.

LICENSING & COMMITMENTS:
- Review eligibility for Microsoft Azure Savings Plans for Compute (more flexible than RIs).
- Reevaluate reserved capacity commitments periodically.
- Group purchases across subscriptions using EA or Microsoft Customer Agreement.

TOOLS & RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use Azure Advisor for cost recommendations across compute, networking, and storage.
- Enable Cost Management + Billing for detailed insights and forecasting.
- Use Azure Pricing Calculator and Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) tool before deployments.
- Schedule cleanups of resources with Azure Automation or Logic Apps.
