Azure Virtual Machines (VM) Best Practices

GENERAL CONFIGURATION:
- Always use Managed Disks instead of unmanaged disks.
- Prefer Gen2 VM images over Gen1 unless compatibility requires otherwise.
- Use availability sets or availability zones for high availability.
- Tag all VMs with purpose, environment, owner, and cost center metadata.
- Set boot diagnostics to enabled with a designated storage account.

AUTHENTICATION & ACCESS:
- Use Azure AD login for Linux and Windows VMs where supported.
- Use just-in-time VM access to limit exposure to RDP/SSH ports.
- Never use password authentication; prefer SSH key or Azure AD.
- Disable the local admin account if not needed.
- Use RBAC for access control to the VM and its resource group.

SECURITY CONFIGURATION:
- Enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud VM protection.
- Apply NSGs (Network Security Groups) to block all unnecessary traffic.
- Restrict RDP/SSH access using IP filtering or Private Link.
- Enable guest OS auto-patching (especially for Windows).
- Monitor VM with Security Center and fix high-severity recommendations.

PERFORMANCE & SIZING:
- Right-size VM SKUs using Azure Advisor and metrics (CPU/mem).
- Use Premium SSD or Ultra Disk for high-performance workloads.
- Monitor disk throughput and latency to detect bottlenecks.
- Avoid overprovisioning; scale out instead of up where possible.

AVAILABILITY & RESILIENCE:
- Use Availability Sets (in single region) or Zones (across datacenters).
- Combine Load Balancers with health probes for frontend VMs.
- Enable Azure Backup for all critical VMs.
- Validate backup restore points regularly.
- Use snapshot automation for additional recovery options.

AUTOMATION:
- Use Azure Update Manager or Automation Account for patching.
- Use Desired State Configuration (DSC) or Azure VM Extensions to enforce configs.
- Use auto-shutdown for dev/test environments.
- Implement VM scale sets if your workload supports it.

MONITORING:
- Enable diagnostic settings and send metrics to Log Analytics.
- Monitor key metrics: CPU, memory, disk IO, network usage.
- Set alerts for critical thresholds (e.g., CPU > 85% for 10 mins).
- Analyze performance trends using Azure Monitor and Workbooks.

BACKUP & DISASTER RECOVERY:
- Use Azure Backup or third-party tools for consistent backup.
- Enable application-aware backup for SQL or other workloads.
- Replicate VMs to a secondary region using Azure Site Recovery (ASR).

COMPLIANCE & GOVERNANCE:
- Enforce tags via Azure Policy.
- Limit allowed VM SKUs and locations via policy.
- Monitor policy compliance in Microsoft Defender for Cloud.

RECOMMENDED TOOLS:
- Azure Advisor for cost, security, and performance recommendations.
- Azure Monitor & Workbooks for VM health and performance analysis.
- Azure Policy for enforcing configurations.
- Microsoft Defender for Cloud for security hardening.
- Azure Backup & Site Recovery for data protection.
