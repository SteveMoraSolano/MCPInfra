Azure Key Vault Best Practices

GENERAL USAGE:
- Use Key Vault to store and manage secrets, keys, and certificates securely.
- Use separate vaults per environment (e.g., dev, test, prod) to avoid accidental access.
- Assign meaningful naming conventions that include environment and purpose.
- Use tags to manage cost allocation and identify ownership.

AUTHENTICATION & ACCESS:
- Prefer **Managed Identity** to access secrets from applications or services.
- Use **role-based access control (RBAC)** over traditional access policies when possible.
- Assign **least-privilege** roles such as:
  - `Key Vault Reader`: for read-only access
  - `Key Vault Secrets User`: for accessing secrets only
  - `Key Vault Administrator`: only where strictly necessary
- Never give users broad rights like full admin unless required.
- Use Azure AD Conditional Access to protect portal and programmatic access.

SECRETS MANAGEMENT:
- Rotate secrets regularly (automate using Key Vault + Logic Apps or Azure Automation).
- Use secret versioning to avoid unintended overwrites.
- Avoid storing secrets in code or environment variables directlyâ€”use Key Vault references instead.
- Audit secret usage with diagnostic logs.

KEYS MANAGEMENT:
- Use customer-managed keys (CMK) if compliance requires more control.
- Use HSM-backed keys (Premium tier) for sensitive workloads.
- Rotate encryption keys regularly or use automatic key rotation (preview or GA).
- Enable soft-delete and purge protection for recovery and tamper protection.

CERTIFICATES MANAGEMENT:
- Use Key Vault to import, create, or manage SSL/TLS certificates.
- Enable automatic certificate renewal using integrated issuers (e.g., DigiCert).
- Monitor certificate expiration proactively to avoid downtime.
- Use Key Vault references in App Services for automatic binding.

SECURITY SETTINGS:
- Enable **soft-delete** and **purge protection** (critical for production vaults).
- Disable public network access and use **private endpoints** when possible.
- Restrict access to the vault using firewall and virtual network rules.
- Enable **Defender for Key Vault** for alerting on suspicious activity.
- Turn on **logging and metrics** (Azure Monitor / Log Analytics workspace).

MONITORING & AUDITING:
- Enable **Audit Logging** (Azure Monitor Diagnostic Settings).
- Send logs to **Log Analytics**, **Event Hubs**, or **Storage Accounts**.
- Monitor for unauthorized access attempts, failed logins, and deletion events.
- Create alerts for operations like secret access, key deletion, or access policy changes.

INTEGRATIONS:
- Use Key Vault integration in:
  - App Service (via App Settings with @Microsoft.KeyVault reference)
  - Azure Functions
  - Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) with CSI Driver
  - Azure DevOps via Key Vault task
  - Azure CLI / PowerShell / SDK (secure coding required)
- Use `az keyvault secret set` and `az keyvault secret show` only in secure, non-interactive scripts.

GOVERNANCE & COMPLIANCE:
- Use Azure Policy to enforce:
  - Only Premium tier usage for vaults with keys
  - Require soft-delete and purge protection enabled
  - Deny public network access
- Perform regular access reviews and audit key usage.
- Restrict certificate issuers to approved providers only.

RECOMMENDED TOOLS:
- Azure Key Vault
- Azure Policy
- Microsoft Defender for Cloud
- Azure Monitor & Log Analytics
- Azure Automation for secret/key rotation
- Azure RBAC + Managed Identity
