Azure Storage Account Best Practices

GENERAL CONFIGURATION:
- Use Standard storage for general-purpose workloads and Premium for low-latency or high-throughput needs.
- Choose the correct performance tier (Standard, Premium) and redundancy (LRS, ZRS, GRS, RA-GRS) based on data criticality.
- Enable soft-delete for blobs, file shares, and containers to protect against accidental deletions.
- Use Storage v2 accounts for full functionality (required for lifecycle management, secure transfer, etc.).
- Enable versioning to keep historical versions of blobs.

SECURITY:
- Enforce HTTPS-only access for all storage accounts (`secure transfer required` = true).
- Use Private Endpoints or Service Endpoints to eliminate public exposure when possible.
- Disable public blob access unless explicitly required.
- Use Azure AD authentication over access keys whenever supported.
- Rotate storage access keys periodically or use Azure Key Vault-managed credentials.
- Enable Microsoft Defender for Storage to detect anomalies and threats.

DATA ACCESS:
- Apply role-based access control (RBAC) for granular permissions.
- Use Shared Access Signatures (SAS) with short expiration and limited scope.
- Enable SAS expiration policy via Azure Policy to enforce short-lived access tokens.
- Monitor data access patterns using diagnostics and log analytics.

REDUNDANCY & RESILIENCE:
- Use GRS or RA-GRS for critical workloads needing geographic disaster recovery.
- For ZRS or GZRS, deploy in supported regions for higher availability.
- Evaluate whether read-access geo-redundancy (RA-GRS) is necessary or wasteful.
- Use lifecycle policies to archive or delete stale data automatically.

PERFORMANCE & SCALING:
- Use Premium storage (e.g., Premium Block Blob) for low latency.
- Monitor capacity limits and avoid reaching storage account transaction limits.
- Use separate storage accounts for high-throughput workloads to avoid throttling.
- Enable Large File Shares feature when using Azure Files for enterprise-scale needs.

LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT:
- Define lifecycle rules to move data to Cool/Archive tiers or delete after retention periods.
- Use tiering for cost optimization: Hot (active), Cool (infrequently accessed), Archive (rarely).
- Combine tagging with lifecycle rules for fine-grained automation.

MONITORING & LOGGING:
- Enable diagnostic settings for Storage to send logs and metrics to Log Analytics.
- Monitor metrics like success/failure rates, latency, availability, egress/ingress.
- Set alerts for abnormal traffic or high error rates.
- Analyze access logs to detect unauthorized access or data exfiltration.

BACKUP & RECOVERY:
- Enable blob soft delete, versioning, and point-in-time restore (PITR) for critical data.
- Enable Azure Backup for Azure Files if needed.
- Enable container soft delete to protect metadata loss.

GOVERNANCE & POLICY:
- Use Azure Policy to enforce secure transfer, public access settings, and key rotation.
- Use tagging for environment, data sensitivity, or project tracking.
- Limit allowed SKUs or access tiers through policy definitions.

RECOMMENDED TOOLS:
- Azure Storage Explorer for manual access and management.
- Azure Monitor and Log Analytics for diagnostics.
- Microsoft Defender for Storage.
- Azure Policy for compliance enforcement.
